This is going to be a blog going forward on different podcasts I and people who submit to the website listen to.

I ask that if you are submitting to the website that you give a few paragraphs on the episode or show you are submitting which will be included with the post.

Also what I would ask also is if you could share a list of your top 5 podcasts that you listen to. Over time I will create an overall list of podcasts to listen to.

To submit please email: mailto:admin@podcast.london
