I created this website as I like to listen to a lot of podcasts on my commute into work.

I am always interested to know what people are listening to and see what different types of podcasts are out there.

My first podcast was probably close to 10 years ago and it was just a recording of [The Science Show from ABC RN](https://www.abc.net.au/radionational/programs/scienceshow/).
I was pretty lucky that this show would go on breaks for times during the summer and for the holidays and so they would broadcast other shows during this time. One of the shows they shared during this time was [Radiolab from WNYC](https://www.wnycstudios.org/shows/radiolab) which to this day is probably one of the best and highly produced podcasts there is.

From Radiolab they had a relationship with [This American Life](https://www.thisamericanlife.org/) which is one of the best short story type shows which covers a particular topic each week. Since they cover so many different topics they normally have submissions from other podcast producers so you get introduced to a lot of different podcasts. It was from here that then my interest in them started to grow and now I have somewhere in the region of 100+ podcasts in my list.

Over time I hope to go through a good portion of these and talk about the best episodes or why I listen to the podcast.
